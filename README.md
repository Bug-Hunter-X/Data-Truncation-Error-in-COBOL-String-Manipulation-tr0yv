This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: data truncation when moving strings between fields with different lengths. The bug.cob file contains code that potentially leads to this error, while bugSolution.cob offers a corrected version. The error occurs when a string longer than the receiving field's length is moved.  This can result in unpredictable behavior and program crashes. The solution involves careful consideration of field lengths and employing appropriate error handling mechanisms.
